# Progress

------------------------------------------------------------

Call to action:
I would like your discretion on creating a program (possibly LLM / NLP but I would like your advice if not) to curate ideal research pathways given a prompt of the researcher's capabilities and a database of all current research publications; I want to accelerate the ability of mankind to research in efficient and powerful directions, taking into account the impact the research would have across fields and therefor its priority.

------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this project is to create a databasing tool to sort through past research articles and generate the ideal next steps to be researched.

TL;DR - lineage based research paper databasing through citations in order to generate ideal research pathways for the most efficient progression of technology and humanity.

- Utilize html scraping to get list of citations on one given paper, record the subject of the paper, keywords, and conclusions
    - in order to use sources that are not free for public access, obtain the information and not provide a copy of the papers
    - contact google to see if it would be possible to access google scholar databases, I would bet they already have this information as they have counters for how many articles an author has been cited within
- Track backwards from paper to which papers contributed to that paper and so forth
    - create network of interconnected research papers and topics, make this network explorable for the purpose of eliminating redundancy in research pathways
        - example: multiple research teams working independently on the same topic
            - can integrate a form of social media for lack of better explanation
                - teams can mark topics they are working on and provide contact information in order to promote communication and idea generation between researchers
                - new form of open source, the new git-hub but for scientific research
- utilize GPT language model / some form of AI to determine the next steps for explicitly stated goals (or even have it generate goals) for respective topics
    - i.e. artificial organs, bone diseases, cancer, etc.
    - Contact [open.ai](http://open.ai) to see if they would be interested in pursuing this after making proof of concept
    - with access to all of this information, a general process for how research typically proceeds can be used as a backbone for prediction of what to do next
        - given this backbone, procedures can be generated and requested to researchers in their fields by the organization (non-centralized ideally) and those findings can lead to new predictions and procedures.
